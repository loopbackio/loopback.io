<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-success" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> <b>Tip:</b>
Hidden and protected properties are subtly different.

- `hidden` determines whether a property is returned by a query directly against the model that contains the property.
- `protected` determines whether a property is returned by a query against a model that has a relation to the model being queried.
