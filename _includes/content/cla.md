## Agreeing to the CLA

Like many open source projects, you must agree to the contributor license agreement (CLA)
before we can accept (merge) your changes. See the [loopback.io CLA](https://cla.strongloop.com/agreements/strongloop/loopback.io) and [loopback-next CLA](https://cla.strongloop.com/agreements/strongloop/loopback-next). 

In summary, by submitting your code or doc contributions, you are granting us a right to use
that code/content under the terms of this agreement, including providing it to
others. You are also certifying that you wrote it, and that you are
allowed to license it to us. You are not giving up your copyright in
your work. The license does not change your rights to use your own
contributions for any other purpose.

Contributor License Agreements are important because they define the
chain of ownership of a piece of software. Some companies won't allow
the use of free software without clear agreements around code ownership.
That's why many open source projects collect similar agreements from
contributors. The LoopBack CLA is based on the Apache CLA.
