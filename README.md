# loopback.io

LoopBack community site, http://loopback.io. This website now includes the LoopBack documentation.

NOTE: The website is served from the `gh-pages` branch.

This repository is provided under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Setup

To preview the website locally:

1.  Install [Ruby and Bundler](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) if you don't have them already.

2.  Clone this repo (you might use the SSH URL instead of HTTPS).:

```
git clone https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io.git
```

3.  `cd` to the repository directory and run the following command:

```
$ cd loopback.io
$ bundle install
```

Bundler will look in the Gemfile for which gems to install. The `github-pages` gem includes the same version of Jekyll and other dependencies as used by GitHub Pages, so that your local setup mirrors GitHub Pages as closely as possible.

## Run and view site locally

Run Jekyll using the following command:

```
$ npm start
```

Then, load [http://localhost:4001/](http://localhost:4001/) on your browser.

NOTE: The docs part will be at [http://localhost:4001/doc](http://localhost:4001/doc). It's not yet linked from the main "overview" part of the site, but will be once we launch (RSN).

## Formatting

Jekyll uses a variant of Markdown known as [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).

Jekyll uses the [Liquid template engine](http://liquidmarkup.org/) for templating.

## Incorporating external READMEs

The documentation incorporates README files from a number of LoopBack example repositories.
We use the [get-readmes](https://github.com/strongloop/get-readmes) utility to fetch
the README files directly from GitHub. Here is how to update the READMEs

1.  `npm install` (_first time/setup only_)
2.  `npm run fetch-readmes`

From there, the README markdown files are incorporated into documentation articles
using the standard Jekyll "include" syntax as follows (for example):

```
---
title: "Angular example app"
lang: en
layout: readme
source: loopback-example-angular
keywords: LoopBack
tags:
sidebar: lb2_sidebar
permalink: /doc/en/lb2/Angular-example-app.html
summary: A brief tutorial on creating an Angular client app using the Loopback AngularJS SDK.
---

{% include readmes/loopback-example-angular.md %}
```

## Incorporating updates from loopback-next

We use a node script `update-lb4-docs` to copy over contents from loopback-next
repository using `@loopback/docs` package. The script is responsible for copying
over the markdown documentation and related tables, as well as the sidebar used
for LoopBack 4 content. The changes are then picked up as part of Travis CI's
builds along with README update scripts and deployed to GitHub Pages once
successful. The `upgrade-swagger-ui.js` script is also run as part of the
builds. If you'd like to make documentation changes for LoopBack 4, please do so
on its own [repository](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/).

### Linting Readmes

There is an additional `npm script` that "lints" the readmes for markdown formatting problems. It is currently "experimental", see [this issue](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io/issues/49#issuecomment-253672668) for more info.

You can run this script thus:

```js
$ npm run lint-readmes
```

## LoopBack.io Docs Search

Docs Search is powered by [IBM Watson Discovery](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/discovery/).

### How it works

LoopBack Docs are uploaded to Discovery by Travis CI (before deploying a new
site -- after changes have been merged into `gh-pages` branch) automatically.
The script creates a new [collection](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/discovery/data-crawler-qs.html#create-a-collection)
and uploads each doc to that. The content of the docs along with certain
metadata can be found in `_site/posts.json`. Travis uploads each Object in that
file as a separate document (only uploads `documentation` pages).

Travis CI has encrypted variables which sets the environment variables for
Discovery username / password. Core team can reach out to Taranveer Virk /
Diana Lau for these credentials if needed.

* Once docs have been uploaded, Travis will delete the previous collection as
  the Search URL uses the oldest collection available to serve results.

If you want to try this out locally, you can create an account for Watson
Discovery (Use the Lite plan which is free). Set the following environment
variables locally:

```
export DISCOVERY_USERNAME="username"
export DISCOVERY_PASSWORD="password"
```

You can now upload docs to your Watson Discovery instance by running

```
npm run discovery-upload
```

### Front End

Each documentation page has a search bar the top. The search will redirect the
user to a `/search` page to show the results. The results are retrieved from a
[IBM Cloud Function](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/functions) that acts as a proxy
to protect Watson Discovery credentials. The search bar also contains a hidden
form input that sets the `sidebar` value and Watson Discovery filters content
based on this value to return context aware results. Ex: Searching for the word
`controller` from a LoopBack 4 documentation page will return LoopBack 4 results.
To search all documents you can search from the `/search` page. Community Docs
and Contribution docs are included in all results.

### Cloud Function

The code for the Cloud function can be found [here](https://github.com/strongloop-internal/loopback-search-function).
It is deployed to the same account and must be edited directly in IBM Cloud
(formerly BlueMix). The repository exists to document code changes and have peer
reviews. Credentials for accessing the Cloud Function can be obtained from
Taranveer Virk / Diana Lau OR you can ask them to re-deploy changes.

#### Your own version

You can deploy the code on your own BlueMix account and upload the URL for
Discovery in [search.html](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io/blob/gh-pages/_layouts/search.html).
For the function to work, you must set the following parameters in the function settings:

```
discovery_username: username
discovery_password: password
```
