# loopback.io

LoopBack community site, http://loopback.io.  This website now includes the LoopBack documentation.

NOTE: The website is served from the `gh-pages` branch.

This repository is provided under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

##  Setup

To preview the website locally:

1. Install [Ruby and Bundler](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) if you don't have them already.

2. Clone this repo (you might use the SSH URL instead of HTTPS).:
```
git clone https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io.git
```
3. `cd` to the repository directory and run the following command:
```
$ cd loopback.io
$ bundle install
```

Bundler will look in the Gemfile for which gems to install. The `github-pages` gem includes the same version of Jekyll and other dependencies as used by GitHub Pages, so that your local setup mirrors GitHub Pages as closely as possible.

## Run and view site locally

Run Jekyll using the following command:

```
$ npm start
```

Then, load [http://localhost:4001/](http://localhost:4001/) on your browser.

NOTE:  The docs part will be at [http://localhost:4001/doc](http://localhost:4001/doc).  It's not yet linked from the main "overview" part of the site, but will be once we launch (RSN).

## Formatting

Jekyll uses a variant of Markdown known as [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).

Jekyll uses the [Liquid template engine](http://liquidmarkup.org/) for templating.

## Incorporating external READMEs

The documentation incorporates README files from a number of LoopBack example repositories.
We use the [get-readmes](https://github.com/strongloop/get-readmes) utility to fetch
the README files directly from GitHub.  Here is how to update the READMEs

1. `npm install` (*first time/setup only*)
2. `npm run fetch-readmes`

From there, the README markdown files are incorporated into documentation articles
using the standard Jekyll "include" syntax as follows (for example):

```
---
title: "Angular example app"
lang: en
layout: readme
source: loopback-example-angular
keywords: LoopBack
tags:
sidebar: lb2_sidebar
permalink: /doc/en/lb2/Angular-example-app.html
summary: A brief tutorial on creating an Angular client app using the Loopback AngularJS SDK.
---

{% include readmes/loopback-example-angular.md %}
```

### Linting Readmes

There is an additional `npm script` that "lints" the readmes for markdown formatting problems. It is currently "experimental", see [this issue](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io/issues/49#issuecomment-253672668) for more info.

You can run this script thus:

```js
$ npm run lint-readmes
```
