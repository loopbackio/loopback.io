          <p>LoopBack has an active and growing open-source community.

<h3 class="c-heading -h3">Governance</h3>

<p>
The LoopBack project governance model follows the spirit and tradition of open source by embracing consensus, forking, and individual ownership.</p>

<h4 class="c-heading -h4">Principles</h4>

<p>
LoopBack is an open, inclusive, and tolerant community of people working together to build a world-class Node framework and tools. We value diversity of individuals and opinions, and seek to operate on consensus whenever possible. We strive to maintain a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment, regardless of the form of communication. When consensus is not achievable, we defer to the owners of each individual module; the powers of the individual owner are kept in check by the ability of the community to fork and replace dependencies on the individual module and maintainer.</p>
