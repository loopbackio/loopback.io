# LoopBack Storage Component

**NOTE: The loopback-component-storage module supersedes [loopback-storage-service](https://www.npmjs.org/package/loopback-storage-service). Please update your package.json accordingly.**

LoopBack storage component provides Node.js and REST APIs to manage binary file contents
using pluggable storage providers, such as local file systems, Amazon S3, or
Rackspace cloud files. It uses [pkgcloud](https://github.com/pkgcloud/pkgcloud) to support cloud-based
storage services including:

- Amazon
- Azure
- Google Cloud
- Openstack
- Rackspace

> Please see the [Storage Service Documentaion](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Storage-component.html).
