LoopBack database connectors implement create, retrieve, update, and delete operations as a common set of methods of
[PersistedModel](https://apidocs.loopback.io/loopback/#persistedmodel).

You can connect models using relations to reflect relationships among data. For more information about relations, see [Creating model relations](Creating-model-relations.html).

The officially-supported database connectors are:
