To begin with, clone the repo you want to fix and create a new branch: `feature/eslint` or name it as you find appropriate.
Following are the steps to introduce ESLint to LoopBack repositories:

To make reviews easier, best practice is to send three separate commits:

- [Add ESLint infrastructure](#add-eslint-infrastructure)
- [Auto-update by ESLint --fix](#auto-update-by-eslint---fix)
- [Fix linting errors](#fix-linting-errors)

## Add ESLint infrastructure

Refer to [this commit](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-remoting/pull/288/commits/17b3bc3e7c17d1595dab1422c1052f8d90d2c27f) for an example.

- Remove all `jshint` and/or `jscs` files, i.e. `.jshintrc`, `.jscsrc` or `.jshintignore` files.
- If the repo:
  - Is not using Grunt, install `eslint` as a `devDependencies` via `npm install eslint --save-dev`.
  - Is using Grunt and depends on `grunt-jshint`, replace it with `grunt-eslint` (no need to install `eslint` as it's already installed as a dep from `grunt-eslint`).
- Update `devDependencies` by installing `eslint-config-loopback`.
  - Run `npm install --save-dev eslint-config-loopback@latest` to ensure the latest version is installed.
- In `package.json`'s `devDependencies` section, set `eslint` version to `^2.13.1`.
  - Please refrain from using version `3.x.x` until LoopBack drops support for versions of Node < 4.
  - See [ESLint requires Node.js 4 or higher](http://eslint.org/blog/2016/07/eslint-v3.0.0-released#requires-nodejs-4-or-higher)

- Add `.eslintrc` file with following content:

  ```json
   {
      "extends": "loopback"
    }
  ```

- Add `.eslintignore` file as well, if applicable.
- If the repository is using `Grunt`, update the `Gruntfile.js` to use `eslint` (refer to the  example commit).
- Scan code base for any occurances of `jshint/jscs` and replace with `eslint` where appropriate.  NOTE: Mac users run `grep -r jshint <dir/file> <dir/file> ...` to find occurences of word `jshint` in a dir/file.
- Modify `package.json` and/or Gruntfile to ensure that linter (`eslint`) is run *after* the tests pass. This typically means adding a `"posttest": "eslint"` script. If the original package contains a `pretest` script to run the linter, then remove the `pretest` script in favor of `posttest`.

Commit with message `Add eslint infrastructure`.

## Auto-update by eslint --fix

Once you set up `eslint` infrastructure, the following steps automatically will eliminate most linting errors, such as comma-dangle errors:

- In a command terminal, go to repo and run following command:
  `./node_modules/.bin/eslint --fix .`

Above command will auto-fix linting errors as per linter rules and will also show the errors it didn't fix.
Commit these changes with message: `Auto-update by eslint --fix`.

## Fix linting errors

{% include note.html content= "
When fixing errors, **DO NOT** change the original code because you might break things and it makes it harder for us to review! If you must change logic, do it in a _separate_ PR.
Disclaimer: this can be a tedious task.
"%}

- From terminal, go to repo and run following command:
  `./node_modules/.bin/eslint .`
  it will display list of errors with a line-number that needs fixup. Take a note of number of errors reported

- If you see a high number of `max-len` violation, then add a custom `max-len` settings to `.eslintrc` as follows:

```json
    {
      "extends": "loopback",
      "rules": {
        "max-len": ["error", 90, 4, {
          "ignoreComments": true,
          "ignoreUrls": true,
          "ignorePattern": "^\\s*var\\s.+=\\s*(require\\s*\\()|(/)"
        }]
      }
    }
```
  Then run `eslint` as in previous step.

  - Try different values (90, 100, 110, 120) and find the lowest one where the number of failing lines is still reasonable.  For example, in `strong-remoting`, `eslint` was reporting 76 errors for `max-len` of `100` and changing it to `90` was reporting `78` errors, thus lowest number `90` would make sense to set as max line length.

- Using `'use strict';` may cause this error:

```
   Uncaught SyntaxError: In strict mode code, functions can only
   be declared at top level or immediately within another function
```

  - Cause: function is declared inside a If/switch...etc block.
  - Solution: Move the function outside the block. For example:

  ```
    function funcName(parameter) {    
    }
    switch() {
      case 1: function() {
        funcName (parameter);
      }
    }
  ```

- Go to the files and fix errors manually and commit.

Push the commit with message: `Fix linting errors`

That's it, open a PR for review!
