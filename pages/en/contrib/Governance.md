## Principles

LoopBack is an open, inclusive, and tolerant community of people working together to build a world-class Node framework and tools. We value diversity of individuals and opinions, and seek to operate on consensus whenever possible. We strive to maintain a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment, regardless of the form of communication. When consensus is not achievable, we defer to the owners of each individual module; the powers of the individual owner are kept in check by the ability of the community to fork and replace dependencies on the individual module and maintainer.

## Maintainers

Each repository has one or more lead maintainers responsible for:

*   Daily operations: approving pull requests, responding to new issues, guiding discussions, and so on.
*   Seeking consensus on technical decisions.
*   Making the final decisions when consensus cannot be achieved.

Maintainers have npm publishing rights for modules and the final say on releasing new versions.

## Lead maintainers

LoopBack lead maintainers include:

*   [Miroslav Bajto≈°](https://github.com/bajtos)

## Scrum board

The LoopBack project uses [Waffle](https://waffle.io/), an agile development tool built on the GitHub API. Waffle provides a easy way to track work and provide project transparency in real time. We use it to groom and maintain our backlog and track what the team and community are working on in each sprint.

See the [LoopBack Waffle Scrum Board](https://waffle.io/strongloop/loopback) for a realtime view of the project. For details on how the LoopBack team uses Waffle, see [the related blog post](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/an-update-on-the-loopback-roadmap-and-backlog/).
