## Contributing

You can contribute to the LoopBack project in several ways. All contributions are welcome!

### Reporting issues

A relatively easy way to contribute is by reporting new issues; see [Reporting issues](Reporting-issues.html) for general guidelines.

New issues start in an un-labelled state. During triage, if the requirements and/or steps-to-reproduce are clear, the issue is labelled as "bug" or "enhancement". If the issue description is not good enough, leave a comment asking the reporter to provide the specific information needed, and label the issue as "triage". Issues that are questions will be redirected to the mailing list and closed straight away.

### Contributing to code

If you're interested in contributing to the code, be sure to read the [code contribution guidelines](code-contrib.html) first. A good place to start is the [list of open and beginner friendly issues](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22beginner-friendly%22).

For code donated by community members and other community-led projects, check out the [GitHub StrongLoop Community Org](https://github.com/strongloop-community).
