## Create an external link

When linking to an external site, use Markdown formatting because it's simplest:

```
[Google](http://google.com)
```

## Linking to internal pages

When linking to internal pages, you can manually link to the pages like this:

```
[Icons](icons.html)
```

However, if you change the file name, you'll have to update all of your links. It's much easier to use Automated links, as described in the next section.
