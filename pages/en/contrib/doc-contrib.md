## How LoopBack documentation works

LoopBack documentation is sourced in both the [strongloop/loopback.io](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io/) and [strongloop/loopback-next](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/) GitHub repositories, and this site is generated using Jekyll and GitHub pages.  Some pages are copied from the `loopback-next` repository's `master` branch into `loopback.io`'s `gh-pages` branch, where this site is published from.  Don't use the `master` branch in the `loopback.io` repository.

When contributing documentation to the `loopback-next` repository, a new version of `@loopback/docs` must be published to `npm` before the changes appear live.  There is a script that runs automatically at 3pm EST to propogate the changes to the `loopback.io` site.

All the pages from the `loopback.io` repo are in the `pages` directory and the pages from the `loopback-next` are stored in the [`docs/site`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/docs/site) directory, which are then copied to [`pages/en/lb4`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io/tree/gh-pages/pages/en/lb4) in `loopback.io`.  Every page also has an **Edit this page** button at the bottom that links to the page in the GitHub repo.

We attempt to review and merge PRs as soon as possible; in general, we'll try to do so within 24 hours during the business week.  Please allow longer over weekends or holidays.

## What to work on

We use GitHub issues to track tasks and bugs.  In general:

- For issues around documentation _content_ (that is the actual information), open an issue in the relevant repository, such as `loopback`, `loopback-datasource-juggler`, `loopback-connector-xxx`, and so on.
    - Under `loopback-next`, use the `Docs` label.
- For issue around the documentation site, layout, or UX, [open an issue in the loopback.io repository](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io/issues/new).

For general guidelines on creating issues, see [Reporting issues](Reporting-issues.html).

It is best practice to search first to make sure someone else hasn't already logged your issue.
Run these helpful GitHub queries to see open documentation issues:

- [Open documentation issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adoc+org%3Astrongloop+) in any strongloop repository.
- [Open issues labeled "needs doc"](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aneeds-doc+org%3Astrongloop+):  these are typically code issues that need to be documented, as opposed to specific doc tasks/problems.
