This site supports translating documentation into other languages.
Currently, we're using "community translation" in which members of the LoopBack community
contribute translations.  This is somewhat more informal than professional translation, since at any
given time the content may be partially translated (even the content on a single page), and translated
content may not stay up with changes to the English content.

In general, a community translator may need to perform two major tasks:

- [Add a new language](Adding_a_new_language.html) to begin translation into a language that is not yet offered.
- [Translate an article](Translating_articles.html) into an existing language.
