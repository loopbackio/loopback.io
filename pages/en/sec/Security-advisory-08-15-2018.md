- **Security risk**: High (CVSS: 7.1)
- **Vulnerability**: `loopback-connector-mongodb` allows NoSQL Injections

### Description

MongoDB Connector for LoopBack fails to properly sanitize a filter passed to query the database by allowing the dangerous `$where` property to be passed to the MongoDB Driver. The Driver allows the special `$where` property in a filter to execute JavaScript (client can pass in a malicious script) on the database Driver. This is an [intended feature of MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/server-side-javascript/) unless [disabled (instructions here)](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/server-side-javascript/#disable-server-side-js).

An example malicious query:

```
GET /POST filter={"where": {"$where": "function(){sleep(5000); return this.title.contains('Hello');}"}}
```

The above makes the database sleep for 5 seconds and then returns all "Posts" with the title containing the word `Hello`.

### The Fix

The connector now sanitizes all queries passed to the MongoDB Driver by default and deletes the `$where` and `mapReduce` properties. If you need to use these properties from within LoopBack programatically, you can disable the sanitization by passing in an `options` object with `disableSanitization` property set to `true`.

**Example:**

```js
Post.find(
  { where: { $where: "function() { /*dangerous function here*/}" } },
  { disableSanitization: true },
  (err, p) => {
    // code to handle results / error.
  }
);
```
