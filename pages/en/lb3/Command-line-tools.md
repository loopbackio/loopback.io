summary: This article summarizes LoopBack CLI tool commands.
---
Use the LoopBack CLI tool, `lb` to create and _scaffold_ applications.  Scaffolding simply means generating the basic code for your application.  You can then extend and modify the code as desired for your specific needs.

The command-line tools provide an [Application generator](Application-generator.html) to create a new LoopBack application and a number of sub-generators to scaffold an application, as described in the following table.
The commands are listed roughly in the order that you would use them.
