# LoopBack considerations for GDPR readiness
 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
### For PID(s): UT:30AH1

## Notice:

This document is intended to help you in your preparations for GDPR readiness. It provides information about features of LoopBack that you can configure, and aspects of the product’s use, that you should consider to help your organization with GDPR readiness. This information is not an exhaustive list, due to the many ways that clients can choose and configure features, and the large variety of ways that the product can be used in itself and with third-party applications and systems.

__Clients are responsible for ensuring their own compliance with various laws
and regulations, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. 
Clients are solely responsible for obtaining advice of competent legal counsel as to 
the identification and interpretation of any relevant laws and regulations that may 
affect the clients’ business and any actions the clients may need to take to comply 
with such laws and regulations.__

__The products, services, and other capabilities

### GDPR

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been adopted by the European Union (“EU”) and applies from May 25, 2018.

#### Why is GDPR important?

GDPR establishes a stronger data protection regulatory framework for processing of personal data of individuals.  GDPR brings:

* New and enhanced rights for individuals
* Widened definition of personal data
* New obligations for processors
* Potential for significant financial penalties for non-compliance
* Compulsory data breach notification

### Product Configuration - considerations for GDPR Readiness
#### Offering Configuration

The following sections provide considerations for configuring LoopBack to help your organization with GDPR readiness.

##### Configuration to support data handling requirements
The GDPR legislation requires that personal data is strictly controlled and that the 
integrity of the data is maintained. This requires the data to be secured against loss 
through system failure and also through unauthorized access or via theft of computer equipment or storage media.

**LoopBack Overview**

LoopBack is an open source Node.js framework that allows you to create REST APIs and connect to the backend resources, such as database and Web services.
- Users can download LoopBack anonymously and use LoopBack without creating any accounts.
- LoopBack itself is not runnable. The close analogy is Spring Framework or IBM Node.js SDK.
- Customers create applications using LoopBack tooling and runtime.
- Since LoopBack allows users to connect to backend resources that might require credentials to access, users can create a LoopBack application in such way that the credentials are stored in the configuration files as part of their LoopBack application.

It is important to note that it is developer's responsibility to design and configure their LoopBack application using the [GDPR Privacy By Design](https://www.eugdpr.org/more-resources-1.html) as guidelines.

##### Configuration to support Data Privacy
It is developer's responsibility to design and configure their LoopBack application using the [GDPR Privacy By Design](https://www.eugdpr.org/more-resources-1.html) as guidelines to support Data Privacy.

##### Configuration to support Data Security
It is developer's responsibility to design and configure their LoopBack application using the [GDPR Privacy By Design](https://www.eugdpr.org/more-resources-1.html) as guidelines to support Data Security.

### Data Life Cycle


#### What types of data flow through LoopBack?

LoopBack is a development framework that does not collect any data and send it back to IBM.  
The LoopBack framework facilitates the connection to backend resources, such as databases and Web services, where identity data is stored.  However, it does not store actual data.  

There are two types of data that are involved in LoopBack: application configuration data and application data. 

1. Application configuration data

    The following files are the LoopBack application configuration data that might captures identity data,
such as database connection information (IP addresses and credentials), in order to connect to the backend resources:
    - `server/config.json`
    - `server/datasources*.json`
    - `server/datasources*.js`
    - `server/model-config.json`
    - `server/middleware*.json`

2. Application data

    LoopBack provides built-in User model that makes the LoopBack applications require authentication. However, it is not compulsary to use.  Besides, developers can create other models that involve personal data, which the LoopBack framework has no control over.  

It is developer's responsibility to design their LoopBack application using the [GDPR Privacy By Design](https://www.eugdpr.org/more-resources-1.html) as guidelines.

#### How is the data being collected

1. Application configuration data

    All information captured in the application configuration files are provided by the developers of the LoopBack application during development time. 

2. Application data

    During the runtime of the application, if the LoopBack application requires authentication, the userid and password might be involved.  Depending on the application developed by the LoopBack users, it might ask the end-users for other personal data. 

#### When is the data being collected?
LoopBack is a development framework that does not collect any data and send it back to IBM.  However, there might be personal data involved in a LoopBack application developed by the users. 

1. Application configuration data

    All information captured in the application configuration files are provided by the developers of the LoopBack application during development time. 

2. Application data

    Depending on the LoopBack application developed by the LoopBack users, application data might be collected at different times during runtime of the application.

##### Personal data used for online contact with IBM

Loopback clients can submit online comments/feedback/requests to contact IBM about LoopBack subjects.

Regarding getting support from IBM as open source community users or paid customer support, LoopBack users might be asked to provide a sample application and output/debug logs for problem reproduction and problem determination. It is important to note that personal data is not needed for this purpose.  If there is personal data included in the application, they should be removed or deidentified before sending it to IBM Support.

For supporting the community users through GitHub, please keep in mind that it is a public platform and anyone who has access to World Wide Web is able to view it. If there is personal data included in the application, they should be removed or deidentified before sending it to IBM Support.

Typically, only the client name and email address are used, to enable personal replies for the subject of the contact, and the use of personal data conforms to the [IBM Online Privacy Statement] (https://www.ibm.com/privacy/us/en/).
