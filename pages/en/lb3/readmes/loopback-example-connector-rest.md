## Overview
This example demonstrates basic use of [loopback-connector-rest](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-connector-rest). 

The project has two servers: `local-server` and `external-server`. The "external" server
serves a simple REST API, while the local server fetches data using
this REST API.

## Running the app

```
$ git clone https://github.com/strongloop-community/loopback-example-connector.git
$ cd loopback-example-connector
$ git checkout rest
$ cd external-server
$ npm install
$ node .
```
In another shell:
```
$ cd local-server
$ npm install
$ node .
```

You should see console messages on the local server. Verify the data has been
retrieved from the remote server by doing a GET request on Magazines in the
explorer or by running `curl localhost:3000/api/Magazines`.

## FAQs
The following are common questions related to using the REST connector.

## How do you perform a GET request to a remote server?
In this example, we have a REST API exposed in [model-config.json](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-rest-connector/blob/master/external-server/server/model-config.json#L31)
.

To make a request to the remote server, declare new datasource that uses the
REST connector in the local [datasources.json](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-rest-connector/blob/master/local-server/server/datasources.json#L6-L20).

A few things to note in this file is the `connector` property's value is `rest` and
there is an `operations` property that takes an array of objects.

This object has two properties: `template` and `function`.

The `template` property contains `method` which is the HTTP method type to
perform the request with and `url` which is the URL to the remote resource.

The `function` property is the name of the property you will use to trigger the
request. For example, we name our property `find` because we will trigger the
request using `Magazine.find()...`.

The idea is to use [`find`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-rest-connector/blob/master/local-server/server/datasources.json#L16) to make a [`GET`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-rest-connector/blob/master/local-server/server/datasources.json#L12) request to a [`url`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-example-rest-connector/blob/master/local-server/server/datasources.json#L13) we specify.
