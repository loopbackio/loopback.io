|  [gracePeriodForClose](./http-server.basehttpoptions.graceperiodforclose.md) | <code>number</code> | The <code>gracePeriodForClose</code> property controls how to stop the server gracefully. Its value is the number of milliseconds to wait before in-flight requests finish when the server is being stopped. With this setting, we also reject new requests from existing keep-alive connections in addition to stopping accepting new connections.<!-- -->Defaults to Infinity (don't force-close). If you want to immediately destroy all sockets set its value to <code>0</code>. https://www.npmjs.com/package/stoppable |
