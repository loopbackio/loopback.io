## http-caching-proxy package

A caching HTTP proxy for integration tests.

## Remarks

\*\*NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION USE!\*\*

Testing applications connecting to backend REST/SOAP services can be difficult: The backend service may be slow, apply rate limiting, etc. Integration tests become too slow in such case, which makes test-first development impractical.

This can be addressed by setting up a snapshot-based mock server or using a caching HTTP client, but both of these solutions come with severe disadvantages:

- When using a snapshot-based mock server, we must ensure that snapshots are up-to-date with the actual backend implementation. - Caching at HTTP-client side requires non-trivial changes of the application code.

A filesystem-backed caching HTTP proxy offers a neat solution that combines caching and snapshots:

- The first request is forwarded to the actual backend and the response is stored as a snapshot. - Subsequent requests are served by the proxy using the cached snaphost. - Snapshot older than a configured time are discarded and the first next request will fetch the real response from the backend.
