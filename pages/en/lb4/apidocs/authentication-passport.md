## authentication-passport package

An adapter to plug in passport based strategies to the authentication system in [@loopback/authentication @3.x](./authentication.md)<!-- -->.

## Remarks

[@loopback/authentication @3.x](./authentication.md) allows users to register authentication strategies that implement the interface `AuthenticationStrategy`<!-- -->.

Since AuthenticationStrategy describes a strategy with different contracts than the passport Strategy, and we'd like to support the existing 500+ community passport strategies, an adapter class is created in this package to convert a passport strategy to the one that LoopBack 4 authentication system wants.

## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [StrategyAdapter](./authentication-passport.strategyadapter.md) | Adapter class to invoke passport-strategy 1. provides express dependencies to the passport strategies 2. provides shimming of requests for passport authentication 3. provides life-cycle similar to express to the passport-strategy 4. provides state methods to the strategy instance see: https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport |
