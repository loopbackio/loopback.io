## Bootstrapper class

The Bootstrapper class provides the `boot` function that is responsible for finding and executing the Booters in an application based on given options.

NOTE: Bootstrapper should be bound as a SINGLETON so it can be cached as it does not maintain any state of it's own.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class Bootstrapper 
```
