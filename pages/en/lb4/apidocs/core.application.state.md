## Application.state property

Get the state of the application. The initial state is `created` and it can transition as follows by `start` and `stop`<!-- -->:

1. start - !started -<!-- -->&gt; starting -<!-- -->&gt; started - started -<!-- -->&gt; started (no-op) 2. stop - started -<!-- -->&gt; stopping -<!-- -->&gt; stopped - !started -<!-- -->&gt; stopped (no-op)

Two types of states are expected: - stable, such as `started` and `stopped` - in process, such as `booting` and `starting`

Operations such as `start` and `stop` can only be called at a stable state. The logic should immediately set the state to a new one indicating work in process, such as `starting` and `stopping`<!-- -->.
