### Synopsis

Adds a new empty controller to a LoopBack application.

```
lb4 controller [options] [<name>]
```

### Options

{% include_relative includes/CLI-std-options.md %}

### Arguments

`<name>` - Optional name of the controller to create as an argument to the command.Â 
If provided, the tool will use that as the default when it prompts for the name.

### Interactive Prompts

The tool will prompt you for:

- Name of the controller. If the name had been supplied from the command line, the prompt is skipped and the controller is built with the name from the command-line argument.

### Output

The tool will create a new file as <code>/src/controllers/<i>controller-name</i>.controller.ts</code>. The file will contain an empty constructor and common package imports that can be uncommented.
