# loopback-connector-mongodb

The official MongoDB connector for the LoopBack framework.

Please see the full documentation at [loopback.io](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb2/MongoDB-connector.html).

## Customizing MongoDB configuration for tests/examples

By default, examples and tests from this module assume there is a MongoDB server
instance running on localhost at port 27017.

To customize the settings, you can drop in a `.loopbackrc` file to the root directory
of the project or the home folder.

**Note**: Tests and examples in this project configure the data source using the deprecated '.loopbackrc' file method,
which is not suppored in general.
For information on configuring the connector in a LoopBack application, please refer to [loopback.io](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb2/MongoDB-connector.html).

The .loopbackrc file is in JSON format, for example:

    {
        "dev": {
            "mongodb": {
                "host": "127.0.0.1",
                "database": "test",
                "username": "youruser",
                "password": "yourpass",
                "port": 27017
            }
        },
        "test": {
            "mongodb": {
                "host": "127.0.0.1",
                "database": "test",
                "username": "youruser",
                "password": "yourpass",
                "port": 27017
            }
        }
    }

**Note**: username/password is only required if the MongoDB server has
authentication enabled.

### Additional Settings

allowExtendedOperators - ```false``` by default, ```true``` allows to use mongo operators like
```$currentDate, $inc, $max, $min, $mul, $rename, $setOnInsert, $set, $unset, $addToSet,
$pop, $pullAll, $pull, $pushAll, $push,  $bit ```.


enableGeoIndexing - ```false``` by default, ```true``` enables 2dsphere indexing for model properties
of type ```GeoPoint```. This allows for indexed ```near``` queries etc.

## Running tests

The tests in this repository are mainly integration tests, meaning you will need
to run them using our preconfigured test server.

1. Ask a core developer for instructions on how to set up test server
   credentials on your machine
2. `npm test`

## Running benchmarks

**Benchmarks must be run on a Unix-like operating system.**

```
make benchmarks
```

The results will be output in `./benchmarks/results.md`.

## Leak detection

Tests run for 100 iterations by default, but can be increased by setting the
env var `ITERATIONS`.

```
make leak-detection # run 100 iterations (default)
```

or

```
ITERATIONS=1000 make leak-detection # run 1000 iterations
```

## Release notes

  * 1.1.7 - Do not return MongoDB-specific _id to client API, except if specifically specified in the model definition
