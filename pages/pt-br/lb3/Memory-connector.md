summary: The built-in memory connector is persistent data source for development and testing.

## Overview

LoopBack's built-in memory connector enables you to test your application without connecting to an actual persistent data source such as a database.
Although the memory connector is very well tested it is not suitable for production.

The memory connector supports:

* Standard query and create, read, update, and delete operations, so you can test models against an in-memory data source.
* Geo-filtering when using the `find()` operation with an attached model.
  See [GeoPoint class](http://apidocs.strongloop.com/loopback-datasource-juggler/#geopoint) for more information on geo-filtering.

The memory connector is designed for development and testing of a single-process application without setting up a database.  It cannot be used in a cluster as the worker processes will have their own isolated data not shared in the cluster.

You can persist data between application restarts using the `file` property. See [Data persistence](#data-persistence) for more information.

## Creating a data source

By default, an application created with the [Application generator](Application-generator.html) has a memory data source defined; for example:

{% include code-caption.html content="/server/datasources.json" %}
```javascript
"db": {
    "name": "db",
    "connector": "memory"
}
```

Use the [Data source generator](Data-source-generator.html) to add a new memory data source to your application.

### Memory connector properties

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Property</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>name</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Name by which you refer to the data source.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>connector</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Must be "memory" to use the memory connector.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>file</td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>
        <p>Path to file where the connector will store data, relative to application root directory.</p>
        <p>NOTE: The connector will create the file if necessary, but the directory containing the file must exist.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If you specify the file property, the connector will save data there that will persist when you restart the application.
Otherwise, the memory connector does not persist data after an application stops.

## Data persistence

By default, data in the memory connector are transient. When an application using the memory connector exits, all model instances are lost.
To maintain data across application restarts, specify a JSON file in which to store the data with the `file` property when creating the data source.

The simplest way to do this is by editing `server/datasources.json`; for example:

{% include code-caption.html content="server/datasources.json" %}
```javascript
{
  "db": {
    "name": "db",
    "connector": "memory",
    "file": "mydata.json"
  }
}
```

You can also set the persistence file in a boot script; for example:

{% include code-caption.html content="server/boot/script.js" %}
```javascript
var memory = loopback.createDataSource({
  connector: loopback.Memory,
  file: "mydata.json"
});
```

When the application exits, the memory connector will then store data in the `mydata.json` file, and when it restarts will load the saved data from that file.
