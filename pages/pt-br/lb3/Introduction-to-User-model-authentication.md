LoopBack provides a full-featured solution for authentication and authorization.
Follow the steps here to get an overview of how it works with the built-in User model using StrongLoop API Explorer.

First, if you haven't done so, follow the first steps in [Getting started with LoopBack](Getting-started-with-LoopBack) 
to download the [loopback-getting-started](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-getting-started) application and run it.

Open [http://localhost:3000/explorer](http://localhost:3000/explorer) to view StrongLoop API Explorer. Then:

## Create a new user

Click on **POST /Users** to create a new user record:

The operation will expand. Under **Parameters**, click on the **data** field and enter a JSON object with email and password properties, for example:

```javascript
{
   "email": "foo@bar.com",
   "password": "xxx"
}
```

The basic User model validates that email has the standard format of an email address, and the password is not empty.

Click **Try it Out!** to submit the request to the REST API. 

You'll see a 200 **Response Code**, and the **Response Body** will show the email address and unique ID of the newly-registered user.

## Login as the new user

Now click on **POST /Users/login** to login as this new user.
Copy and past the same JSON containing the email and password you entered previously to the **credentials** field, then click **Try it Out!**:

{% include image.html file="9830498.png" alt="" %}

Now the response will contain the authorization token for the user:

{% include image.html file="9830497.png" alt="" %}

## Set access token

Select and copy the value of the **id** property in the **Response Body** and paste it into the **accessToken** field in the upper right of the API Explorer window:

{% include image.html file="9830496.png" alt="" %}

After you do this, the message will change to **Token Set**. At this point, the user you created is now logged in and authenticated to the application.

You can now execute certain REST operations; for example, click **GET /Users/{id},** enter 1 in the id field, and click **Try it Out!** to fetch the user model instance data for your own user record:

{% include image.html file="9830495.png" alt="" %}

Certain operations are restricted, even if you are authenticated. For example, you can't view other users' records.
