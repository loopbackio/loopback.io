summary: LoopBack applications come with a built-in API Explorer you can use to test REST API operations during development.

{% include content/gs-prereqs.html lang=page.lang %}

You're not the only one who'll use the API you just created.  That means you'll need to document your API.  Fortunately, LoopBack provides API Explorer for you. 

{% include note.html content="If you followed [Create a simple API](Create-a-simple-API.html), keep that app running and skip down to [Run API Explorer](#run-api-explorer).

If you're just jumping in, follow the steps below to catch up...
" %}

Get the app (in the state following the last article) from GitHub and install all its dependencies:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-getting-started.git
$ cd loopback-getting-started
$ git checkout step1
$ npm install
```

## Run API Explorer

Run the application:

`$ node .`

Now go to [http://localhost:3000/explorer](http://localhost:3000/explorer).  You'll see the StrongLoop API Explorer showing the two models this application has: **Users** and **CoffeeShops:**

In addition to the CoffeeShop model that you defined, by default Loopback generates the User model and its endpoints for every application.  

## About LoopBack built-in models

Actually, LoopBack creates several other [built-in models](Using-built-in-models) for common use cases:

## Exploring the CoffeeShop model

Right now, you're going to "drill down" on the CoffeeShop model. Click on **CoffeeShops** to show all its API endpoints:

{% include image.html file="5570640.png" alt="" %}

Scan down the rows of the API endpoints: you can see that they cover all the normal create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations, and then some.

Click on the first row, **POST  /CoffeeShops **   **Create a new instance of the model and persist it into the data source **to expand that operation:

{% include image.html file="5570641.png" alt="" %}

Follow the instructions in the diagram above.

Click in Model Schema to get a JSON "data template" that you can edit in the **data** field.  

Add some text for the `name` property.  You don't have to put anything for the `id` property, because LoopBack will automatically manage it to ensure there is always a unique ID for each model instance.

```js
{
  "name": "My Coffee Shop",
  "id": 0
}
```

Then click the **Try it out!** button.

You'll see information on the REST request submitted and the application's response (for example):

{% include image.html file="5570642.png" alt="" %}

The **Response Body** field will show the data that you just entered, returned as confirmation that it was added to the data source.

Now click on **GET  /CoffeeShops** to expand that endpoint.  Click **Try it out!** to retrieve the data you entered for the CoffeeShop model.  You should see the record you created using the POST API.

If you are so inclined, try some other requests: You can enter more complicated [queries](Querying-data) 
using the **filter** field to specify a [Where filter](Where-filter), 
[Limit filter](Limit-filter), and other kinds of filters on the query. 
See [Querying data](Querying-data) for more information.

{% include tip.html content="
API Explorer automatically adds \"filter\" to the query string, but you must enter [Stringified JSON](Querying-data.html#using-stringified-json-in-rest-queries) in the **filter** field. Also make sure that the quotes you use are proper straight quotes ( \" ), not curved or typographic quotation marks ( “ or ” ). These can often be hard to distinguish visually.
" %}

You may have noticed the **accessToken** field and **Set Access Token** button at the top right of the API Explorer window. Use these to authenticate a user and "login" to an app so you can perform actions that require authentication. For more information, see [Introduction to User model authentication](Introduction-to-User-model-authentication).

{% include next.html content="In [Connect your API to a data source](Connect-your-API-to-a-data-source.html), you'll learn how to persist your data model to a database such as MongoDB."
