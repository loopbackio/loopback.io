{% include important.html content="LoopBack 3.0 is the current production release.
It was released for general availability on 21 Dec 2016; see the [release announcement](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/announcing-loopback-3-0-ga/).
LoopBack 2.0 is now the [LTS release](/doc/en/contrib/Long-term-support.html).

## Upgrading to version 3.0

To upgrade to LoopBack 3.0, simply enter this command:

```
npm install -g strongloop
```

For more information, see [Updating to the latest version](Updating-to-the-latest-version.html).

## Migrating your app to version 3.0

Read the [Migration Guide](Migrating-to-3.0.html) for instructions on upgrading
to LoopBack 3.0.

The [Release Notes](3.0-Release-Notes) provide a comprehensive reference for
all the changes between 2.x and 3.0.

## Getting started

1. **[Install LoopBack tools](Installation)**.  Currently only StrongLoop tools (`slc`) support LoopBack 3.0.
1. **Read [LoopBack core concepts](LoopBack-core-concepts.html)** to learn about key concepts you need to understand to use LoopBack.
1. **Follow [Getting started with LoopBack](Getting-started-with-LoopBack.html)** for a quick tutorial introduction.

Check out the [LoopBack Developer Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/loopbackjs) to ask questions and discuss how you are using LoopBack.

## The LoopBack framework

The LoopBack framework is a set of Node.js modules that you can use independently or together to quickly build REST APIs.

A LoopBack application interacts with data sources through the LoopBack model API, available locally within Node.js, [remotely over REST](Built-in-models-REST-API), and via native client APIs for
[iOS, Android, and HTML5](Client-SDKs). Using these APIs, apps can query databases,
store data, upload files, send emails, create push notifications, register users, and perform other actions provided by data sources and services.

Clients can call LoopBack APIs directly using [Strong Remoting](Strong-Remoting.html), a pluggable transport layer that enables you to provide backend APIs over REST, WebSockets, and other transports.

The following diagram illustrates key LoopBack modules, how they are related, and their dependencies.
