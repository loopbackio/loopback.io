These endpoints are part of the [PersistedModel REST API](PersistedModel-REST-API.html), but are presented here for ease of reference.

## Get related model instances

Follow the relations from one model to another one to get instances of the associated model.

`GET /<model1-name>/<instanceID>/<model2-name>`

### Arguments

* `<instanceID>` - ID of instance in model1.
* `<model1-name>` - name of first model. 
* `<model2-name>` - name of second related model.

### Example

Request:

`GET http://localhost:3000/locations/88/inventory`

Response:

```javascript
[
  {
    "productId": "2",
    "locationId": "88",
    "available": 10,
    "total": 10
  },
  {
    "productId": "3",
    "locationId": "88",
    "available": 1,
    "total": 1
  }
]
```

## Get hasMany related model instances

List related model instances for specified `<model-name>` identified by the `instance-ID`, for hasMany relationship.

`GET /<model-name>/<instance-ID>/<hasManyRelationName>`

## Create hasMany related model instance

Create a related model instance for specified `<model-name>` identified by `<instance-ID>`, for hasMany relationship.

`POST /<model1-name>/<instance-ID>/<hasMany-Relation-Name>`

## Delete hasMany related model instances

Delete related model instances for specified <model-name> identified by `<instance-ID>`, for hasMany relationship.

`DELETE /<model1-name>/<instance-ID>/<hasMany-relation-name>`

## List belongsTo related model instances 

List the related model instances for the given model identified by `<instance-ID>`, for hasMany relationship.

`GET /model-name/<instance-ID>/<belongsTo-relation-name>`

## Aggregate models following relations

It's often desirable to include related model instances in the response to a query so that the client doesn't have to make multiple calls.

`GET /<model1-name>?filter[include]=...`

**Arguments**

* `include` - The object that describes a hierarchy of relations to be included
