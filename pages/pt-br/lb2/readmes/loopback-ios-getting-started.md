# LoopBack Guide Application (for iOS)

The LoopBack Guide Application provides an easy-to-digest example application
from UI to data and back again.

## Installation

The Guide assumes you have [XCode][xcode] installed and a running LoopBack application.

 1. Clone the Guide Application: `git clone https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-guide-app`.
 1. Open the project: `open loopback-guide-app/LoopBackGuideApplication/LoopBackGuideApplication.xcodeproj/`.
 1. Now in XCode, run the Application with `Cmd+R`.

## Using the Guide

Once you have the Guide running, flip through the pages and familiarize yourself
with what the app does. From there, dive into the Objective-C and see _how_ it
does it. There are comments for everything.
