The [loopback-sdk-builder](https://github.com/mean-expert-official/loopback-sdk-builder) module enables you to create an [Angular 2](http://angular.io/) client SDK for a LoopBack application.  It is a community module forked from the official loopback-sdk-angular and refactored to support Angular 2.

{% include note.html content="
This module is provided and supported by the LoopBack community (led by [Jonathan Casarrubias](https://github.com/jonathan-casarrubias)). StrongLoop and IBM are not directly responsible for it and do not provide support for it.
