                        "Space Invoices is a developer first invoicing API. LoopBack allowed us to quickly deliver a fully featured REST API on par with standards that our customers (developers) expect and understand without having to code extensive query-ing functions and standard CRUD endpoints. The framework is fully-featured, robust, well documented and very much alive and evolving, all of which were crucial requirements for us when choosing the right solution in the Node.js ecosystem."
